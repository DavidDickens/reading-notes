1. **What are variables in JavaScript?**

- Variables are containers for storing data (storing data values).

    **When to Use JavaScript var? **

- Always declare JavaScript variables with var,let, orconst.

    The var keyword is used in all JavaScript code from 1995 to 2015.

    The let and const keywords were added to JavaScript in 2015.

    If you want your code to run in older browsers, you must use var.

2. **What does it mean to declare a variable?**

- Creating a variable in JavaScript is called "declaring" a variable.

    You declare a JavaScript variable with the var or the let keyword:

3. **What is an “assignment” operator, and what does it do?**

- Assignment operators assign values to JavaScript variables.  

- The assignment operator = assigns the value of its right-hand operand to a variable, a property, or an indexer element given by its left-hand operand. The result of an assignment expression is the value assigned to the left-hand operand.


4. **What is information received from the user called?**

- PromptIt will show a pop-up window with the text provided as the first parameter and with a textbox the user can fill in. When the user presses OK, the value in the text box will be returned by the prompt() function. Then, in this example we use the document.write method to update the html with the text.

- Confirm he other pop-up is not really an input method. It allows the developer to ask a Yes/No question. Calling the confirm() function will show a pop-up window with the provided texts and with two buttons. If the user presses OK the confirm() function will return true, if the user presses cancel or hits the ESC key, the function will return false.
