# **Class 8: Operators and Loops**

1. **What is an expression in JavaScript?**

    - At a high level, an expression is a valid unit of code that resolves to a value. There are two types of expressions: those that have side effects (such as assigning values) and those that purely evaluate.  

    - An expression is any valid set of literals, variables, operators, and expressions that evaluates to a single value. The value may be a number, a string, or a logical value. Conceptually, there are two types of expressions: those that assign a value to a variable, and those that simply have a value.

    - Loops offer a quick and easy way to do something repeatedly.

3. **When does a for loop stop executing?**

    - A for loop repeats until a specified condition evaluates to **false**.

    **Example**

        for (initialization; condition; afterthought)
            statement

4. **How many times will a while loop execute?**

    - A while statement executes its statements as long as a specified condition evaluates to true.

    **Example**

        while (condition)
            statement
