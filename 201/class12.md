## Class 12 Notes

## What does the 'canvas' allow a developer to acheive?

- Canvas enables you to easily integrate a third-party application in Salesforce. Canvas is a set of tools and JavaScript APIs that you can use to expose an application as a canvas app. This means you can take your new or existing applications and make them available to your users as part of their Salesforce experience.

## What is the importance of the closing 'canvas' tag?

- The reason that canvas tag requires a separate closing tag is because it's actually possible to put content inside that will display instead of the canvas if the user's browser does not support HTML5

## Explain what the getContext() method does.

- The getcontext() function initializes the structure pointed to by ucp to the current user context of the calling process. The ucontext_t type that ucp points to defines the user context and includes the contents of the calling process's machine registers, the signal mask, and the current execution stack.
