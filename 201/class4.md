# class 4 Notes

## To create a basic link, we wrap text or other content inside what element?

- A basic link is created by wrapping the text or other content inside an <a> element and using the href attribute, also known as a Hypertext Reference, or target, that contains the web address.

## The href attribute contains what information?

- For link elements, the href attribute specifies the location (URL) of the external resource (most often a style sheet file).

## What are some ways we can ensure links on our pages are accessible to all readers?

- Create Accessible Hypertext Links  
- Use concise and meaningful text for links.  
- Do not capitalize all letters in links.  
-Avoid using URLs for link text.  
- Do not use the word "link" as part of the link text.  
- Do not use tooltips/screentips to add additional information.  

## What is meant by “normal flow”?

- Normal Flow, or Flow Layout, is the way that Block and Inline elements are displayed on a page before any changes are made to their layout. The flow is essentially a set of things that are all working together and know about each other in your layout. Once something is taken out of flow it works independently.

## What are a few differences between block-level and inline elements?

- Difference Between Inline and Block Elements in HTML
Block elements always start from a new line. Inline elements never start from a new line. Block elements cover space from left to right as far as it can go. Inline elements only cover the space as bounded by the tags in the HTML element.

## ___ positioning is the default for every html element.

-  Static positioning is the default that every element gets.

## Name a few advantages to using absolute positioning on an element.

- Aside from a few IE bugs, very good cross-browser support.  
- Less dependence on floats, which can be problematic.  
- ess dependence on margins, which can be a bit buggy in older IE.  

## What is a key difference between fixed positioning and absolute positioning?

- Absolutely positioned elements are positioned with respect to a containing block, which is the nearest postioned ancestor. If there is no positioned ancestor, the viewport will be the containing block. Elements with fixed positioning are fixed with respect to the viewport—the viewport is always their containing block.

## Describe the difference between a function declaration and a function invocation.

- A function expression is very similar to, and has almost the same syntax as, a function declaration. The main difference between a function expression and a function declaration is the function name, which can be omitted in function expressions to create anonymous functions.

## What is the difference between a parameter and an argument?

- Argument Vs. Parameter : Explore the Major Difference between Argument and Parameter. The values that are declared within a function when the function is called are known as an argument. Whereas, the variables that are defined when the function is declared are known as a parameter.
