## Class 7 Notes

## Explain why we need domain modeling.

- Domain modeling is a great tool for Agile enterprise to carry out a common language and a fundamental structure important for the analysis of features and epics. The domain model is defined and continuously refactored as enterprise knowledge about the domain improves and the system functionality evolves

## Why should tables not be used for page layouts?

- HTML tables were originally intended to be used for presenting tabular data, not for layout. The World Wide Web Consortium (W3C®) discourages use of tables for layout because they are striving for a web in which content and structure are completely separate from presentation.

## List and describe 3 different semantic HTML elements used in an HTML 'table'.

- An HTML table consists of one <table> element and one or more <tr>, <th>, and <td> elements. The <tr> element defines a table row, the <th> element defines a table header, and the <td> element defines a table cell.

## What is a constructor and what are some advantages to using it?

- A constructor is a special member method which will be called by the JVM implicitly (automatically) for placing user/programmer defined values instead of placing default values. Constructors are meant for initializing the object.


## How does the term this differ when used in an object literal versus when used in a constructor?

- Objects created using object literal are singletons, this means when a change is made to the object, it affects the object entire the script. Whereas if an object is created using constructor function and a change is made to it, that change won't affect the object throughout the script.

## Explain prototypes and inheritance via an analogy from your previous work experience.

- In JavaScript, an object can inherit properties of another object. The object from where the properties are inherited is called the prototype. In short, objects can inherit properties from other objects — the prototypes.

## Things I want to know about

- I need to know about prototype and inheritance. When to use what. I understand the basics but the overall theory I dont really understand.

- I want to know more about the limitations of constructors and object literals.
