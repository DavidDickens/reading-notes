## Class 8 notes

## Flexbox is designed for one-dimensional content. Explain what this means.

- Flexbox is a one-dimensional layout model that was designed to provide greater control over alignment and space distribution between items within a container. Being one-dimensional, it only deals with layout in a single direction - columns or rows - at a time. This works well for smaller layouts, such as components.

## Explain the difference between the main axis and cross axis.

- The cross axis runs perpendicular to the main axis, therefore if your flex-direction (main axis) is set to row or row-reverse the cross axis runs down the columns. If your main axis is column or column-reverse then the cross axis runs along the rows.

## How can using certain properties of flexbox negatively impact accessibility?

- You should be cautious when using any properties that reorder the visual display away from how things are ordered in the HTML document, as it can negatively impact accessibility. The row-reverse and column-reverse values are a good example of this. The reordering only happens for the visual order, not the logical order. This is important to understand as the logical order is the order that a screen reader will read out the content, and anyone navigating using the keyboard will follow.

## What are some advantages of using flexbox over float?

- Instead of using a float to create layouts by floating elements to the left or the right, flexbox allows you to create layouts by aligning items to a single axis. The axis can be horizontal or vertical. It is best used for distributing space for items in the same axis.

## How does this topic connect with your long term goals?

- For me it doesn't since I hope to not have to use CSS very often. I think it is good to know and understand the basics but going deep into for me makes it harder to understand. Having been exposed to it will help down the road so for that I am greatufl. 

## Things i want to know more about

- Nothing. This is as much CSS as I hope to have to learn. I know thats not the case but one can hope.
